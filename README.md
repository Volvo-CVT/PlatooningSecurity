# PlatooningSecurity

## Introduction
Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) intends to improve safety for humans and traffic efficiency on the roads. This requires the vehicles to communicate wirelessly within which information are naturally exposed to intruders. Cyber-attacks such as intentional modification, injection of bogus information and reading out critical data while transmitted, can cause extremely fatal consequences. It also opens possibilities for adversaries to breach privacy, e.g. by location tracking. Real-time communication requirement by many C-ITS applications, limited resources on the nodes, limited bandwidth in the network where the vehicles should be assumed mostly offline nodes, makes it challenging to develop a robust secure solution for V2X communication.
